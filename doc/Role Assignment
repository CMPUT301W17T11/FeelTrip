 ----------------- Meeting notes Feb 28 2017 -----------------
 Next time we need to decide who researches this stuff
 
1. Research different methods to sync offline/online. We are supposed to use Elastic search and to deal with its shortcomings
2. How to display images and storing them
3. How to use google maps API (Open street maps)
4. Elastic search skills 
5. How to implement themes

Project Part 4:
Need to get half the code base done.
Thinking that we need the main screen, profile page, mood events, and started on maps 
hopefully can also start on elastic search and storing images
