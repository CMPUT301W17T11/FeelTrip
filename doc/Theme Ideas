Unique ideas for a theme:

1) Galaxy
- Purple splash screen
- Sized star sprites
- Periodically animate (change brightness, change size, change "twinkle")
- No major updates to UI icons other than color

2) Overwatch
- Home button -> Overwatch logo
- Simple splash screen
- Nothing animated, but total rehaul on the theme icons
